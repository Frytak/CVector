# WARNING! WIP!

![Test workflow badge](https://github.com/Frytak/CVector/actions/workflows/test.yaml/badge.svg)

This is my own implementation of vectors in C which I made as I was solving the 2023 [AOC](https://adventofcode.com/about) ([my solutions here](https://github.com/Frytak/AdventOfCode2023)) using C (and refined it a little from that point). I have never really used C or C++, but I wanted to learn more about them and put my knowledge of data structures to use.
